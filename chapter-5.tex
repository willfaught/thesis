\chapter{Future Work}

The model of computation is sufficient to enable the interoperation of languages with incompatible evaluation strategies.  Certainly other data types could be added to the model, but they would add nothing new to the method of resolving incompatible evaluation strategies and would further complicate the model.  The implementation of the model would be more useful if additional language constructs and data types were added.  Performance would improve if modules were compiled to bytecodes or machine code.  Adding languages with other evaluation strategies, such as normal order and applicative order, or languages with static type systems that do not support parametricity, would be interesting, but the sizes of the model and proof would grow exponentially.  Further explorations of incompatible evaluation strategies would best be tackled with pairs of languages to minimize complexity.
