\chapter{Future Work}

The model of computation is sufficient to express the interoperation of languages with conflicting evaluation strategies and demonstrate the resolution of those conflicts.  Certainly other data types could be added to the model, but they would add nothing new to the method of resolving conflicts between evaluation strategies and would further complicate the model.  The implementation of the model would be more useful if additional language constructs and data types were added.  Performance would improve if modules were compiled to bytecodes or machine code.  Adding languages with other evaluation strategies, such as normal order and applicative order, would be interesting, but the sizes of the model and proof would grow exponentially.  Further explorations of conflicting evaluation strategies would best be tackled with pairs of languages to minimize complexity.
