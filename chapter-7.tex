\chapter{Conclusions}

This work resolved three language incompatibilities in a system of interoperation for three diverse languages.  It resolved incompatible type systems with contracts for higher-order functions and lump types.  It resolved incompatible support for parametricity with label types.  It resolved incompatible evaluation strategies with delayed conversions for list constructions.  It defined a model of computation that can express interoperation where the aforementioned incompatibilities arise and resolve them, provided a proof of type soundness, and described an implementation of the model that supported additional language features.
