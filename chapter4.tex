\chapter{Conclusion}

Our method of interoperation resolves incompatible lazy and eager evaluation strategies transparently. The eager evaluation strategy mirrors the lazy one for reducible expressions inside the lazy language's boundaries in incompatible evaluation contexts common to both languages. Forced and unforced evaluation contexts and values comprise a simple framework that implements such a system. This method could be extended to resolve incompatible evaluation strategies for any pair of languages with common expressions.
