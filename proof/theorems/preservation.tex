\begin{theorem}
\label{pn}
If $\Gamma\vdash_{A}e_{A}^{1}:T$ and $e_{A}^{1}\rightarrow e_{A}^{2}$ then $\Gamma\vdash_{A}e_{A}^{2}:T$ where $A\in\lbrace H,M\rbrace$.  If $\Gamma\vdash_{S}e_{S}^{1}:TST$ and $e_{S}^{1}\rightarrow e_{S}^{2}$ then $\Gamma\vdash_{S}e_{S}^{2}:TST$.
\begin{proof}
By cases on the reductions $e_{A}^{1}\rightarrow e_{A}^{2}$ and $e_{S}^{1}\rightarrow e_{S}^{2}$ and Lemma \ref{ecp}.  Straightforward cases of Scheme preservation are elided.
