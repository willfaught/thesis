\section{Introduction}

The complexities of software interoperation in part engender the proverbial reinvention of the wheel. Programmers forgo existing solutions to problems in other programming languages where interoperation proves too cumbersome; they remake solutions, rather than reuse them. To unburden programmers to facilitate reuse, interoperation must resolve disparate programming language features transparently at the boundaries between programming languages. To address part of this problem, this paper presents a model of computation that resolves interoperation between lazy and eager evaluation strategies.

The systems of interoperation presented by Matthews and Findler \cite{matthews07} use call-by-value evaluation strategies that eagerly evaluate expressions. Were a language introduced to their system that uses a call-by-name evaluation strategy that lazily evaluates expressions, interoperation would change the meaning of values converted between the lazy language and the eager ones. For example, since the application of a converted function involves applications in both the outer and inner languages, the argument is subject to both outer and inner evaluations strategies. If the outer language is lazy and the inner language is eager, the argument may be evaluated by the inner language but not the outer language, thereby violating assumptions about the order of evaluation by the outer language and thus changing the meaning of the function. Futhermore, the conversion of a composite type like lists from a lazy language to an eager language may diverge or cause an error, since the outer language will eagerly convert the entire value, and the value may be of infinite size or contain expressions assumed by the inner language to not be immediately evaluated.

Lazy and eager evaluation take opposite approaches: lazy evaluation evaluates expressions for primitive operations as needed, and eager evaluation evaluates all expressions. As such, lazy evaluation evaluates a proper subset of the expressions that eager evaluation does. In other words, the set of lazy evaluation strictness points is a proper subset of that of eager evaluation. The difference between these two sets is the set of incompatible strictness points that may change the meaning of values converted from lazy languages to eager ones. Where guarded expressions of lazy languages occur at these points, the original lazy evaluation must be followed, and the guards not evaluated. This requires introducing a dual notion of values, where \emph{forced} values and evaluation contexts force the evaluation of lazy guards, and \emph{unforced} values and evaluation contexts prevent their evaluation. Unforced values and evaluation contexts appear at incompatible strictness points, and forced values and evaluation contexts appear everywhere else.
